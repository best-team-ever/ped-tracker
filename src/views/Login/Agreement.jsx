  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "3.\tRIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF USERS \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Each user has the right to access IT resources necessary for their job: \n" +
  "\n" +
  " This right is strictly personal. \n" +
  "It may be revoked at any time in the event of use non-compliant with the authorisation granted, or in the event of evident non-compliance with use guidelines. It ceases when the professional activity that required it comes to an end (even provisionally). \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Each user is responsible for the IT resources made available to them. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "IT resources must be used professionally and honestly. \n" +
  " Moderate use for everyday private business is tolerated, providing this private use of resources does not affect business activities. However, storage, viewing or communicating data under copyright (music, videos, photos, non-catalogued software etc.) or ethically or morally unacceptable material using Group infrastructures is forbidden. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Each user is responsible, at their level, for protection of Group data: \n" +
  " Users are responsible for protecting their data. They must save all professional data to the intended directories, to be sure of server backups. They keep confidential files secure using passwords. Helpdesk can provide assistance. \n" +
  " Users must only access their own information, and information that is published or shared with any workgroups they belong to. Users undertake not to read, edit, copy or destroy any data not belonging to them without clear agreement from the data owner, even if the data owner has not sufficiently protected the data. In the event a user accidentally gains access to information they are not usually authorised to, they must immediately quit the access and inform the IT department of the issue. \n" +
  " This rule also applies to private conversations and correspondence such as email where the user is not the recipient or copied to the message. \n" +
  " Users are responsible for the accesses and rights they grant to other users, and for the use made of them by these other users. \n" +
  " Users undertake not to voluntarily disturb the smooth running of group information systems, whether by abnormal use or by introducing malware. \n" +
  " Users must inform their IT department of any abnormal operations they notice, or any attempted hacking of their account. \n" +
  " Printed documents must be collected from printers, faxes and photocopiers promptly, and stored securely according to their confidentiality. After use, documents must be archived or destroyed in accordance with their confidentiality. \n" +
  " Portable devices such as storage devices must never be left in full view of others (lying on the desk, left in a car, in a public place). \n" +
  " Storage materials that are no longer in use must be erased, with the assistance of IT services if necessary, before being disposed of. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Every user must observe internal and external regulations in force in the following areas:\n" +
  "\n" +
  "1.\tAccess, profiles and passwords: \n" +
  "\n" +
  " Access to different IT resources requires a profile and password. These are given to staff on their arrival. The password must be changed at the first log on.  \n" +
  " The password must be changed every month, or immediately if it is compromised or revealed. \n" +
  " Users must never communicate their password, no write it down. \n" +
  " They must never use or attempt to use any profile other than their own, or \"lend\" their own profile. Equally, they must never seek to hide their identity. \n" +
  " A good password contains at least 8 characters, does not use names, common nouns, or series of numbers and letters. It uses both upper and lowercase characters, figures and special characters. \n" +
  " Each entity may be required to reinforce physical or logical access through the use of a specific system for its organisation (access badge, chip card, biometric systems, secure access filter etc.). \n" +
  "\n" +
  "2.\tWorkstations and access to information: \n" +
  "\n" +
  " Users may only log on to the network using the hardware provided for them. \n" +
  " They may not change the settings or configuration of their computer, or install non-catalogued software. \n" +
  " Users may not bypass the use restrictions in place for software provided by the company. \n" +
  " They must lock their workstation when not at their desk. \n" +
  " Users must close applications in use correctly and shut down their workstation each evening. \n" +
  " They must inform the IT department of any problems that may affect security (unusual behaviour, suspicious software etc.) \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Specific to portable devices: Laptop computers, PDAs,\n" +
  "telephones, USB devices etc. \n" +
  "\n" +
  " Mobile devices are allocated to a person. They are allocated according to objective criteria linked to the individual's job (number of trips off-site, organisation of meetings, specific temporary requirements etc.). \n" +
  " Users take care of the hardware and the data contained on it as if it were their own: \n" +
  "•\tThey do not lend hardware to others and do not expose it to extreme conditions (humidity, sun, heat etc.). \n" +
  "•\tWhen travelling, users keep the hardware close at hand or store them securely. \n" +
  "•\tWhen users are away from their desk for a considerable time, they store the hardware securely (hidden and locked away). \n" +
  " They regularly connect to their home network to backup data to servers, update security tools, and deploy security patches. \n" +
  " They do not affix stickers to their laptop that advertise their employer in public places. \n" +
  " In the event of loss or theft, the user makes a report to the local police department and informs their manager and the IT department as soon as possible. In the event of evident negligence, the user may be held personally responsible for the theft and the cost of the stolen hardware may be billed to them. \n" +
  " Users make use of filtering screens to prevent people close by from overseeing the information displayed on screen. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\t\n" +
  "\n" +
  "3.\tUse of communication and exchange tools: \n" +
  "\n" +
  "The company provides staff with various messaging tools that meet their needs for internal and external professional communication (email, IM, telephones and standard mail). Moderate and reasonable use of these tools for everyday private business is tolerated, providing this private use of resources does not affect usual business communication traffic. \n" +
  "\n" +
  " Users must not use emails to communicate anything they would not say (spoken word). Users are reminded that the authors of offensive, racist, pornographic, defamatory, sexually or morally inappropriate content may be held criminally responsible. \n" +
  " Email users are responsible for use by a third party if they should reveal their password or leave their email account accessible during their absence. \n" +
  " The email address given by the group to its staff should only be communicated for professional business directly linked with the company's activities. \n" +
  " No information regarding the Group's internal organisation, or that of its companies, its activities, its tools, or economic performance, may be communicated by phone to a third party who has not been formally identified. \n" +
  " By the same token, no confidential information may be sent via non-secure email to an address outside the company, given that these messages are sent via internet and may be intercepted by unknown third parties. \n" +
  " An automatic filter monitors all messages sent to and received from outside the company. This filter will block potentially dangerous messages such as spam, messages with certain attachments, messages containing clearly non-professional material (identified with a keyword filter), or messages of an inappropriate size. If a message is mistakenly blocked, users can request its release by the IT department. \n" +
  " A tool is in place that logs the headers of all messages sent to and received from outside the company (sender, recipient, date, subject, size, names of attachments). This log is kept for 6 months. It is only accessible to email administrators and the Chief Information System Security Officer (CISSO), in order to solution technical issues or for monitoring in the event of infringement of this charter's rules. \n" +
  " Filtering using keywords also enables monitoring of the sending of confidential information relating to the company, its results, methods, procedures and so on. The Group CISSO can access a copy of all messages caught by the filter, for monitoring purposes and to prevent information leaks. \n" +
  " Email system administrators are only authorised to consult the content of individual email accounts when requested to do so by the Group CISSO as part of investigations into technical issues or infringement of the rules set out in this charter. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "4.\tUse of internet services: \n" +
  "\n" +
  "Internet access is allocated to users whose jobs require it. This access can be revoked at any time if it is in the company's interests. \n" +
  " Internet access is intended exclusively for professional use. Occasional and reasonable browsing for personal use is tolerated as long as the rules of use are observed. \n" +
  " When browsing the internet, users must remember that their profile contains the company's name, and that their actions may directly affect the group's brand image. \n" +
  " Additionally, all of a user's online activity (sites visited, messages exchanged, data entered into forms, data collected without the user's knowledge etc.) may be captured by unknown third parties, and analysed to identify interests for marketing or other use. Users must take every necessary precaution in this respect. \n" +
  "\n" +
  " Users must not: \n" +
  "-\tUse any internet connection means other than those provided by the company. \n" +
  "-\tConsult illegal websites or sites that are morally or socially unacceptable (incitement to violence, pornography, paedophilia, revisionism, xenophobia, incitement to racial hatred), or that denigrate individuals, protection of children, or that are defamatory or offensive. \n" +
  "-\tDownload, stream, store or communicate information: \n" +
  "•\tRelating to the item above. \n" +
  "•\tThat may damage company resources (non-catalogued software) or the Group's public image or that of its entities. \n" +
  "•\tSubject to copyright (music, images, films, software). \n" +
  "-\tUse company tools for the purposes of harassment, threatening or abusive behaviour.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Monitoring and filtering of internet traffic \n" +
  "\n" +
  " The IT department deploys automatic filtering means using categorisation of visited sites or keyword filtering in accordance with the general rules of use described above, and reserves the right to prohibit or restrict access to some site categories (in particular illegal, morally or socially unacceptable or potentially dangerous sites). \n" +
  " Within the limits laid out by law, user connection data (profile, workstation used, addresses of sites visited, length of connection and visits, volumes downloaded etc.) are recorded to enable regular audits, to ensure quality of service, security and observation of the rules for use. The Group CISSO has access to this data. \n" +
  " These logs are kept for a specified time, set in accordance with applicable legislation. \n" +
  " In the event of disciplinary action following non-compliant use of internet, individual audit data may be provided as proof. \n" +
  "\n" +
  "Extranet \n" +
  "There is an extranet service for exchanging professional documents with previously authorised partners. All exchanges made through this platform are logged in order to monitor the confidentiality of information exchanged.\n" +
  "\n" +
  "Forums, blogs, wikis, collaborative workspaces\n" +
  "\n" +
  " Participation in forums, blogs, wikis and collaborative workspaces is authorised for professional use only. \n" +
  " Users must observe the following use guidelines: \n" +
  "•\tTake care not to damage the Group's public image \n" +
  "•\tDo not give any information on how our information systems operate, or divulge any confidential information \n" +
  "•\tDo not speak on behalf of the group's entities on matters that do not fall under their professional responsibility. \n" +
  " Internal group discussion groups accessible on intranet are moderated. This means the owner has the right and responsibility to delete messages that are not directed related to the subject in question, or that do not observe the rules above. \n" +
  " The Group may not be held responsible for infringements by a user who did not comply with these rules. \n" +
